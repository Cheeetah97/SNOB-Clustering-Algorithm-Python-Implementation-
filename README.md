# SNOB-Clustering-Algorithm-Python-Implementation-

This repo contains the Python implementation of the Snob Algorthim presented in the paper "Wallace's Approach to Unsupervised Learning: the Snob Program". The Snob function, originally present in Matlab is implemented in Python using Oct2py.

Steps:

1) Install Octave on your system
2) Install Python Library Oct2py
3) Export Snob files to your working directory
4) Modify Clustering.m file as per your input and output file locations.
